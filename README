This project demonstrates my ability to teach myself Javascript, HTML and CSS. Having a personal website has always been an interesting idea to me,
and I figured it would be a good oppurtunity to dip my toes in a bit of web-development. All of the code besides the parallax effect used from 
https://templatemo.com/tm-525-the-town is my own.
